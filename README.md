# Automated-Test-Case-Generation-Based-on-Differential-Evolution-with-Node-Branch-Archive

## 1. Introduce

â€‹We proposeed a node branch archive strategy, which can record the relationship between node branch direction and the value of test case variables, and cover more paths through this driven search-based algorithms. The experimental results show that compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the differential evolution with node branch archive (NBAr-DE) can significantly reduce the number of redundant test cases and the time consumption.

## 2. Code instructions

The instructions for using the code are as follows: 

You can select the corresponding search based algorithm to verify the experimental results. 

The specific functions are as follows:

| Premium                         | 2    | 11      | 35      |

 The selection part of function settings is as follows:

```java
	private static final int fun_num = 1; //Test Case ID
	private static final int R = 3;// input variable dimension
	private static final int PATHNUM = 2;//number of existing paths
	private static final int NODENUM = 1;//Number of nodes
```
